## Description
Retrip - Connect your trip
the idea of our application is to help Travelers to connect with each other, share their experiences, find local tips, and discover new places, also provide recommendations for tourist attractions based on user. based on what the user likes and also provides packages for several tourist attractions according to several parameters such as city, price, category, and also time.

### Recomendation System
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features. In this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes.

### Dataset

we were inspired by this data set to build our recommendation system in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/azharianisah/infotempatwisata) and in [here](https://data.world/cityofaustin/m964-vp2q)

But we decided to build our own dataset because we didn't find the right dataset for our project. We make a dummy dataset [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lq6qeYAhBJBJbuyC9DpwKehQ6mWswMkd-NMfbDlkwnw/edit?pli=1#gid=990183666)
